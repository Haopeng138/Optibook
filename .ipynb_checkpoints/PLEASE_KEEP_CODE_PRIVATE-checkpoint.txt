Hey there!

We hope you're having a great time playing with Optibook. We kindly ask you to please not share or make any solutions
you come up with public, as it enables cheating for future participants. We've had issues with this in the past, so
please help keep the challenge fair and do note share solutions publicly.

That means no public git repositories, or any other public solution sharing. Private git repositories are okay.

Do note, it is fine to create private repositories!

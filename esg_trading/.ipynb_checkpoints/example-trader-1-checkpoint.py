EXAMPLE AUTO TRADER

Do not edit this file directly. Instead, copy it somewhere else in your workspace.
These are simple bots that illustrate the Optibook API and some simple trading concepts. These bots will not make a profit.

This is an example bot that trades a single instrument C2_GREEN_ENERGY_ETF.
All it does is to randomly insert either a BID or an ASK every 5 seconds.
The price at which it inserts is equal to the opposite side of the order book.
Thus, if the best bid in the order book is currently 90, it will send a sell order for price 90.
If the best ask in the order book is 91, it will send a buy order for price 91.

The order type this bot uses is IOC (immediate or cancel). This means that if the order does not
immediately trade, it will not be visible to others in the order book. Instead, it will be cancelled automatically.
